        <h2>What does the company do, or offer?</h2>
        <p>FormGuide is a specialized service that provides bilingual (Chinese-English) step-by-step guides for filling out IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) forms. We translate complex government forms, add visual markers and annotations to explain each field, and provide clear instructions in Chinese to help users complete visa applications, study permits, and other immigration documents accurately.</p>

        <h2>Why might this company entice someone to purchase a product or service?</h2>
        <p>Filling out IRCC forms incorrectly can lead to application rejections, delays, and additional costs. FormGuide eliminates the fear and confusion by providing clear, culturally-aware translations and visual guides. For Chinese elderly users and students with limited English, our service transforms a stressful, error-prone process into a confident, step-by-step journey. Users purchase our service because it saves time, reduces anxiety, increases accuracy, and ultimately helps them successfully complete their immigration applications without costly mistakes.</p>
